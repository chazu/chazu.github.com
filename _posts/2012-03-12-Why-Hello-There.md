If I had a nickel for every time I have rebooted my blog in the last two years, I would have ten cents. The time has come to reboot once more, thanks to the alluring simplicity of Jekyll Bootstrap.  Therefore I'll say a few words about myself, in case someone who isn't personally acquainted with me stumbles across this page.

I am an INFP on the Meyers-Briggs personality test. I enjoy eating most vegetables, fruits and other foodstuffs, but I do not consider myself a foodie. I tend to eat very quickly. I am currently employed as a Project Manager at SmartLinx Solutions, a labor management software firm which caters primarily to the long-term care market.

I have very diverse interests, including various fields associated with programming and software development, which are likely the topics I will be discussing here most often. These fields include humanities computing, procedural generation, web app development using Rails, python development, TUI development, self-quantification, productivity and so forth and so on.
 
I have many other interests which will probably not be mentioned here. For the record, these interests include playing music (primarily the drums), hastily building gunpla and cuddling with my dog.
