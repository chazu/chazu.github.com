I've migrated a couple of old posts from my last blog platform, just for the sake of convincing myself it's worthwhile to keep a blog in the first place. This is probably the worst part of migrating blogs, if only because it gives you the same feeling that you get from leafing through notebooks full of your adolescent lyrical poetry. I'm exaggerating, of course, but it's still a relevant point.  

Overall, first impressions of Jekyll Bootstrap are highly favorable. Its quite easy to use and minimal in presentation. I would like to use Twitter Bootstrap for Rails in an upcoming project, as it would eliminate the need for building a distinct interface for mobile browsers.
