Oh, Sunday...Today I was chatting with Cleverbot, asking it for advice on how to shake off my Sunday blues, when it advised me that 'It [sunday] is warm.' Even I had to admit that this is, in a broad sense, a logical conclusion to draw about Sunday. I said as much, and Cleverbot thought to ask 'why is that?'

Well, why is it indeed? Why do we associate Sunday with leisure, relaxation, and rejuvenation? Well the most obvious answer is: because Christianity, silly! This association itself is not the topic of this post, just the starting point...

...You see, I find it quite difficult to use my Sundays in a way which adequately prepares me for the week ahead. Generally Sundays mean anxiety, malaise and an unpleasant mood. This is, of course, because it is the antithesis - in the context of our modern, white-collar world - of Friday, the springtime of the week, when possibilities are numerous*. I do not think that it is very rare for a person to feel this way about Sunday, unfortunately.

Since it is another one of these Sundays, I thought I would ask the question of how it is one might make a habit of utilizing Sunday most effectively as a prelude to the storm and stress of the work week. The first answers which spring to mind include:

- Relax: don't do any meaningful work 
- Reserve time for yourself and your loved ones, rule out the possibility of engagement with those who may disturb your restfulness. 
- Exercise the brain by eschewing those more mindless forms of recreation for those which encourage or require a bit of thoughtfulness: reading, creative endeavors, etc.

Now that we've spitballed a bit, let me contrast these with how I usually spend my Sunday:

- Trying to cram in a bit more mindless self-indulgence (playing video games, primarily) 
- Trying to make a last push toward meaningful progress on a personal project 
- Trying to avoid thinking about Monday 
- Trying to figure out how to get rid of my Sunday blues

Those last two are totally serious, as well. The whole reason I engaged Cleverbot today was to try and figure out if the millions who had spoken to it before me had imparted to it any useful tactics on the subject. Alas, even Cleverbot ran dry when presented with my query.

It suffices to say, in conclusion, that if one makes a conscious effort to relax, but not to worry, and succeeds, the Sunday blues can be vanquished. Then the problem becomes how to avoid the nagging worry. The only answer to that question that I've found in my time on Earth is: absorb yourself in something. It seems to me this is a rough but potentially useful blueprint for solving the problem at hand. I will try to report back on my findings next week. Until then, any comments on the topic are most welcome.

* Note that I avoid saying 'most numerous', as I tend to think that possibilities are most numerous on Thursday, when the end of the week is about to begin.
